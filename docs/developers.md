# Procedural Equirectangular Textures

The source code of the project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/boytchev/texture-generator).
It is licenced under [MIT licence](https://github.com/boytchev/texture-generator?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme).


## Generators

The project manages a collection of individual pattern generators
distributed as JS modules. Each generator supports cutomization
parameters. 

* [camouflage.js](camouflage.md)
* [cave-art.js](cave-art.md)
* [clouds.js](clouds.md)
* [concrete.js](concrete.md)
* [entangled.js](entangled.md)
* [fordite.js](fordite.md)
* [grid.js](grid.md)
* [isolines.js](isolines.md)
* [marble.js](marble.md)
* [planet.js](planet.md)
* [photosphere.js](photosphere.md)
* [polka-dots.js](polka-dots.md)
* [scream.js](scream.md)
* [simplex-noise.js](simplex-noise.md)
* [stars.js](stars.md)
* [water-drops.js](water-drops.md)
* [zebra-lines.js](zebra-lines.md)


## Low-level API

The core of all generators is also available as JS modules.
They could be used is one wants to build own generator of
equirectangular textures.

* [texture-generator.js](api-texture-generator.md)
* [generator.js](api-generator.md)
* [material.js](api-material.md)
* [noise.js](api-noise.md)

## Help needed

If you are willing to help, here are few major to-do items,
where help is needed:

* Using **TSL** to modify the material shaders<br><small>*&ndash; currently their
source is modified via onBeforeCompile*</small>
* Using **WASM, WebWorkers** or other technology to speed up
texture generation<br><small>*&ndash; currently
textures are generated by JavaScript code, run in the main
thread*</small>
* Using **shaders** for higher performance or animated textures
<br><small>*&ndash; currently the
generation is done into a 2D canvas in JavaScript*</small>
* Using **other textures**, especially ones imitating
known materials<br><small>*&ndash; currently generators are
added based on spare time and inspiration of one person*</small>
